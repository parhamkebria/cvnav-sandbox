# Data Files Notice

The large dataset files are not included in this repository due to GitHub's file size limitations:

- `auair2019data.zip` (2.2GB) - Main drone image dataset
- `auair2019annotations.zip` (3.9MB) - Flight annotation files

## To run this project:

1. **Download the data files** from your original source
2. **Place them in the project root** directory (`/home/parham/AuAir/`)
3. **Extract if needed** and update paths in `config.py`

## Alternative data storage solutions:

- **Google Drive**: Share large files via Google Drive links
- **AWS S3**: Use cloud storage for datasets
- **Git LFS**: For future projects, consider Git Large File Storage
- **OneDrive/Dropbox**: Other cloud storage services

## Project status:
✅ All source code, scripts, and documentation are in this repository
✅ Complete development history preserved in `CHAT_HISTORY.md`
✅ Ready to run once data files are added locally
